/* This is where I will implement a user model... eventually.
 *
 * User Schema
 * ---- User_1          | Tables are connected with a foreign-key
 *      User_1_Table_1  | This way a user will only have access to their individual tables and those related to it
 *      User_1_Table_2  |
 * ---- User_2
 *      User_2_Table_1
 *      User_2_Table_2
